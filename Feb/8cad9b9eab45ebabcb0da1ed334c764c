ITHOLE ukugxekwa ezinkundleni zokuxhumana i-ANC ngesinqumo sayo sokungamxoshi ePhalamende uMnuz F. W. De Klerk owayengumengameli¬† wokugcina wobandlululo kuleli. USomlomo wasePhalamende uNkk Thandi Modise namanye amalungu ePhalamende ngaphandle kwe-PAC akhombise ukungahambisani nesiphakamiso samalungu e-EFF ePhalamende sokuthi acelwe ukuba aphume ePhalamende uDe Klerk ngaphambi kwenkulumo kaMengameli Cyril Ramaphosa ebhekiswe esizweni. I-EFF ishicilele ivideo kaDe Klerk ekhuluma neSABC ngezinsuku zobandlulo avela kuyo ethi ubandlululo kwakungelona icala elibhekiswe esizweni (crimes against humanity). Kule video uDe Klerk uthi: ‚ÄúAngivumelani nalokho (ukuthi ubandlululo kwakuyicala elalibhekiswe esizweni), futhi angisho ukuthi lwalulungile ubandlululo ngalokhu engikushoyo,‚Äù¬† kusho yena. ‚ÄúNgaxolisa kaningi ngalokho, kodwa ukhona umehluko ekubizeni into ngecala elibhekiswe esizweni, njengengokubulawa kobuhlanga obubodwa, izikhathi zobandlululo kuleli zazingekho njalo yingakho ngithi ngeke ukuqhathanise lokhu kokubili,‚Äù kusho De Kerk. Kule ngxoxo uDe Klerk uqhuba aveze ukuthi empeleni abantu abamnyama babebulalana bodwa kakhulu uma kuqhathaniswa nalabo ababulawa amaphoyisa obandlululo amhlophe. [MUST WATCH]: This is why the EFF in Parliament demanded that De Klerk be removed from the house. #SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/vt71kw5jqq NgoLwesine i-EFF ithe ngenxa yale nkulumo ngeke ikwazi ukuba ngaphansi kophahla olulodwa noDe Klerk ngokunjalo nongqongqoshe wamaBhizinisi kaHulumeni uMnuz Pravin Gordhan abamsola ngokuhluleka ukuguqula isimo sawo. Ezinkundleni zokuxhumana abantu bazwakalise ukuphoxeka kwi-ANC ngokuvikela uDe Klerk. UNksz Zindzi Mandela, oyindodakazi yowayenguMengameli wakuleli uDkt Nelson Mandela noNkk Winnie Madikizela-Mandela ubuze ukuthi i-ANC isimeleni ngempela? ‚ÄúNjengelungu le-ANC elithembekile inhliziyo yami ibuhlungu ukwazi ukuthi lento (ukuboshwa) yenzeka kumama wami nabanye abaningi ngaphansi kombuso kaDe Klerk. Ngokwenkulumo yakhe, kulungile lokhu, okusho ukuthi umama nabanye kwakubafanele ukuphathwa ngalesi sihluku. Yini esiyimele?‚Äù kubuza yena kuTwitter. As a loyal and dedicated member of @MYANC I am heartbrokenüíîthis happened to my Mother and many others under De Klerk's watch. According to his interview, he justified this, therefore saying that that my Mother and others deserved this aggression. What do we stand for? pic.twitter.com/wN0dPorOQ2 UNobhala-jikelele we-ANC uMnuz Ace Magashule ngemuva kwenkulo kamengameli Cyril Ramaphosa ukuchithile okushiwe nguDe Klerk engxoxweni neSABC kodwa wathi besingekho isidingo sokuthi axoshwe ePhalamende ngoba ubeyingxenye yokwakhiwa kohulumeni wentando yabantu.  No! we should never ever be apologetic, or even worse, apologize, to #FWDeKlerk. APARTHEID WAS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY! De Klerk presided over the #BoiphatongMassacre, #ThirdForceViolence, & terrible apartheid crimes. He should be arrested, tried and imprisoned for these crimes. pic.twitter.com/Go48O7Gjse Understand this please.The reason De Klerk and his people do not think Apartheid was a crime against humanity is because they don't view black people as humanity. Simple as that. De Klerk didn‚Äôt do anything but fold. He didn‚Äôt bring freedom to the people ...he succumbed to the people‚Äôs pressure That‚Äôs no ones hero. That‚Äôs someone we defeated We don‚Äôt celebrate these people Guys come on ! De Klerk is a confessed criminal who represents many other criminals. He CANNOT be allowed to sit in Parliament as if he is an ordinary citizen. It is grossly disrespectful to the entire nation. EFF is 100% spot on here! #SONA2020 On Former President De Klerk's presence in the House. #SONA2020 pic.twitter.com/1Sr5Fqz8N9
